Run the program via the main method in SPath.java
It prompts you to enter one number. Enter one between 1-25 as that is how many vertices there are in our example
Enter second number after - same logic as above

The program will give you 
1. The edges within the shortest path between your first chosen vertex (source) and your second chosen vertex (destination).
2. Sum, Average and Std Deviation of the edges within that path
3. The shortest path between your first chosen vertex (source) and your second chosen vertex (destination).
4. It'll give you a table format of the shortest path to each vertex from your source vertex showing also the parent node it passed 
to get there.

I stored the edges in CSV file into arrayList. I created Edge class and stored each edge as edge object into object arrayList.
